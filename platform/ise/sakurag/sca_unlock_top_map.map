    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  11,072    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     3 out of  11,662    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of  23,324    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            8
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             1 out of       8   12%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       8    0%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               8 out of  93,296    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
